Ich verstehe zwar nicht warum und was das bringen soll, aber folgende Meldung gibt es im off. US WoW Forum:



> 
 In 1.9, the way raid timers are handled will undergo a significant change. The new system will have all instances reset at a certain server time, regardless of when you were actually saved to the instance. The reset times are as follows:


> 
>   * Molten Core: Every 7 Days, resetting during weekly maintenance.
> 

>   * Blackwing Lair: Every 7 Days, resetting during weekly maintenance
> 

>   * Temple of Ahn’Qiraj (40-man): Every 7 Days, resetting during weekly maintenance
> 

>   * Onyxia: Every 5 Days
> 

>   * Zul'Gurub: Every 3 Days
> 

>   * Ruins of Ahn’Qiraj (20-man): Every 3 Days
> 

The resets, if not during weekly maintenance, are planned to occur during off-hours when the least amount of raids are active. We plan on implementing a calendar of sorts on the website to help you better plan out your particular raid schedule. There are many reasons why this particular approach was chosen; we've gone over a multitude of options and felt that this change would be best in the long run.
