<blockquote>Having the role of “Product Designer” or having a CEO who says they’re going to “focus on product design now” never made much sense to me. Aren’t you hiring smart people who use your product? Don’t you trust your employees? Doesn’t everyone at your company want to make your product better? Doesn’t that make everyone product designers all of the time?</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://warpspire.com/posts/product-design/">Product design at GitHub — Warpspire</a>
