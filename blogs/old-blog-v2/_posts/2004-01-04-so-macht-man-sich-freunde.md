&quot;What NOT to do during the Return of the King&quot; [via Email]

1. Stand up halfway through the movie and yell loudly, &quot;Wait... where the hell is Harry Potter?&quot;

2. Block the entrance to the theater while screaming: &quot;YOU SHALL NOT PASS!&quot;

3. Play a drinking game where you have to take a sip every time someone says: &quot;The Ring.&quot;

4. Point and laugh whenever someone dies.

5. Ask everyone around you if they think Gandalf went to Hogwarts.

6. Finish off every one of Elrond's lines with &quot;Mr. Anderson.&quot;

(Ich muss zugeben, das habe ich gemacht. Hat meine Sitznachbarn fast wahnsinnig gemacht. Aber erst beim zweiten Schauen, beim ersten Mal (OV) hatte ich zwei Schwedinnen neben mir sitzen, die hat das mangels Verst&auml;ndnis nicht gest&ouml;rt.)

7. When Aragorn is crowned king, stand up and at the top of your lungs sing, &quot;And I did it.... MY way...!&quot;

8. Talk like Gollum all through the movie. At the end, bite off someone's finger and fall down the stairs.

9. Dress up as old ladies and reenact &quot;The Battle of Helms Deep&quot; Monty Python style.

10. When Denethor lights the fire, shout &quot;Barbecue!&quot;

11. Every time Elrond appears, shout out (in your best 'Dobby' voice) &quot;Clothes! Master gave Elrond Clothes!&quot;

12. In TTT when the Ents decide to march to war, stand up and shout &quot;RUN FOREST, RUN!&quot;

13. Every time someone kills an Orc, yell: &quot;That's what I'm Tolkien about!&quot; See how long it takes before you get kicked out of the theatre.

14. During a wide shot of a battle, inquire, &quot;Where's Waldo?&quot;

15. Talk loudly about how you heard that there is a single frame of a nude Elf hidden somewhere in the movie.

16. Start an Orc sing-a-long.

17. Come to the premiere dressed as Frankenfurter and wander around looking terribly confused.

18. When they go in the paths of the dead, wait for tense moment and shout, &quot;I see dead people!&quot;

19. Imitate what you think a conversation between Gollum, Dobby and Yoda would be like.

20. Release a jar of daddy-long-legs into the theater during the Shelob scene.

21. Wonder out loud if Aragorn is going to run for governor of California.

22. When Shelob comes on, exclaim, &quot;Man! Charlotte's really let herself go!&quot;

24. After the movie, say &quot;Lucas could have done it better.&quot;
